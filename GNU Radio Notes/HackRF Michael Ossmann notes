HackRF Michael Ossmann notes

These are notes from Michael Ossmann's youtube lessons on using the HackRF

1) GRC Osmocom Source:
	- set Device Arguments to "hackrf"		(with the double quotes)
 	- set Ch0 RF Gain to 0					(zero)
		- this turns off the antenna receiver amplifiers
		- not needed -- unless the arriving RF signals are very weak

2) QT GUI Frequency Sink:
	- turn on Average (Medium)
